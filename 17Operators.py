# Python Operators

x = 20
y = 30

# Arithmetic Operations

print(x + y) # Addition
print(x - y) # Subraction
print(x * y) # Multiplication
print(x / y) # Division
print(x % y) # Modulus (Returns the remainder)
print(x ** y) # Exponentiation
print(x // y) # Floor Division

# Assignment Operators

x = 15 # Assigns the value 15 to x
x += 3 # Adds 3 to x
x -= 3 # Subtracts 3 from x
x *= 3 # Multiplies x by 3
x /= 3 # Divides x by 3
x %= 3 # Give the remained of x divided by 3
x //= 3 # Floor Divides x by 3
x **= 3 # Exponentiates x by 3
x &= 3
x |= 3
x ^= 3
x >>= 3
x <<= 3

# Comparison Operators
